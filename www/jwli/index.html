                    Our History
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three
                    visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and
                    Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the
                    Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on experience and
                    training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and
                    leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an
                    Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of
                    social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make
                    a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this
                    program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in
                    Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based
                    nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons
                    College School of Management's Center for Gender in Organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. - Japan Foundation,
                    JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012
                    and 2013, these public forums provided information about the nonprofit sector
                    and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take
                    leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
                    advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.

                    Atsuko Toko Fishretired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant, and is currently involved
                    with various social innovative movements as a philanthropist. She is also a trustee of the
                    Fish Family Foundation. In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese Disaster Relief
                    Fund - Boston (JDRFB) with The Boston Foundation (TBF) and the Japan Society Boston (JSB)
                    to support immediate and mid-term recovery in the affected regions of Tohoku. Atsuko
                    visited Tohoku several times after the disaster to assessed and evaluated the needs of the
                    people and community. In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised
                    approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects
                    working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB's $1 million
                    grants were leveraged to have $6 million of economic impact.
